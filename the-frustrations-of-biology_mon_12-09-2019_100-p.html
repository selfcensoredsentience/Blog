                         <h2 class="section-heading">Still Smoking</h2>
                         <p>There’s a nice cool breeze. Every time I smoke I tell myself this is the last one, but I can’t stop. It's an odd addiction. [Its] weird to think about how much our biology rules us. Consciously I want to stop but something keeps making me buy them. It's frustrating. Not sure what to write about now. I was just looking for something to do and I figured why not get outside and journal.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Healthy and Unhealthy Relationships</h2>
                         <p>I talked to [M] about the “cost-benefit human” idea. She said it's important to do it on every interaction and to define it as healthy or not healthy and to view that as a part of the whole length of the relationship. To always strive to bring those relationships to healthy. That makes a lot of sense. Its alot less dehumanizing. I guess I tend to view things too logically and forget about the human element. She's good at that. That's something I should work on. Not sure where to start with that though. It’s good to realize that logic is a strength I have, but also good to try to improve other aspects.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Porn</h2>
                         <p>I’m addicted to porn. It’s just another in a long list of things I say that I want to stop, but can’t. Sexual pleasure feels good, but I think I’ve indulged too much. Even now while writing this I’m toggling back and forth to my phone looking at porn. I feel powerless and gross. It's easy to just say I’m going to stop, but actually following through is hard. I’ve tried, but can’t. I always relapse.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Hard to be Vulnerable</h2>
                         <p>I have issues opening up. This journal is supposed to be <s>medical</s> unfiltered stream of consciousness writing, but I still find myself self-censoring. There are some thoughts that I have that I don't want to write down for a few reasons. I don’t want anyone to find this journal and read what I said, but also I think the act of writing it out will make me have to confront it. Like writing it out is an acknowledgment or an admission so then I have to answer it or explain it.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Something Light</h2>
                         <p>I had to take a quick break. My back was hurting. It's nice and peaceful out here. I wonder why I flirt. I like the attention. I was going to start doodling because I didn’t really want to think about this stuff. I wanted something light. <s>I think I’m going to</s> I don’t know what I want to do. I’m smoking another cigarette.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Is it Selfish to Kill Yourself?</h2>
                         <p>Is it wrong to kill yourself? Maybe the reason determines if it's right or wrong. How about boredom and dissatisfaction? Is that good enough? Why does it matter? Once you're gone you don’t really have to work through the consequences. That seems selfish but maybe that's ok. Maybe I’m selfish. Humans only have one life. Why is it wrong to just look out for yourself? To just be concerned with maximizing your own good and happiness.</p>
