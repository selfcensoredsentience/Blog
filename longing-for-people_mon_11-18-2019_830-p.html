                         <p>Full of meat, cheese, bread, wine, and nicotine. I still feel empty and lost. I’m sitting here listening to music. A playlist I’ve named “hopeful despair.” It started with three songs. All jazz. Duke Ellington’s “A Single Petal of a Rose”; Bill Evan’s “Skating In Central Park”; Miles Davis’ “The Thought Crossed My Mind”. The songs sound full of despair and loss but still hopeful.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Publishing my Journal</h2>
                         <p>I was talking to someone about potentially publishing these writings and since then I’ve been trying to be more purposeful and precise about what I write, but I think that goes against why I’m writing in here. I want this to be unfiltered and unedited. I should forget the idea of publishing this but it’s hard. I feel sick in my stomach.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Being an Outsider</h2>
                         <p>It’s cold. I’m wearing shorts and a windbreaker, so I didn’t really dress for the weather. I love looking at the city. Part of me feels like its window shopping. I’m staring at this beautiful city, but I feel like an outsider. I feel like I don’t belong. Like I can’t afford to be in and the city doesn’t want me. As I read that, I know its dumb. For a couple of reasons. The city isn’t conscious and doesn’t have any wants or not wants. I just feel like an outsider. I feel rejected by my friends. Everyone has their own lives and I feel guilty trying to inject myself in their. Even with that guilt I still try. I seek out people to feel less alone. I change myself when I’m with them so maybe they will like me more and allow me to stay for longer. Going off of that thought, maybe I’m a people pleaser. I want people to like me so I do what I think they will like. That's not good. I should be myself, but myself alienates people. I’m mean. I’m also probably too into myself. I mean like I think I’m really smart or deep. Just read the stuff I’ve been writing in here and you’ll see that. </p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Why Do I Journal?</h2>
                         <p>Why am I writing in here? On some level I think it’ll help me. On the other hand, it's something to do besides just being on my phone. Here I am try[ing] to define meaning and explain everything. It sort of feels silly. I hear that therapy is good so I want to try it, but this is going egotistical, but I think I was too smart for my last therapist. In my experience and what I’ve heard from those who have gone to therapy, it's a one sided thing. The point is, in the case of me, just talk through their thoughts and occasionally the therapists will ask “why?” or say “continue...” I want there to be a dialogue. A session trying to understand why and how. I don’t know if that's the intention of therapy, but I like that. I think I’m done writing now.</p>
