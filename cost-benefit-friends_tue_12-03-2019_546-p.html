                         <h2 class="section-heading">Use Me Up</h2>
                         <p>I’m back. Not really sure what to write about this time. I just feel like I should be writing something. I still feel alone. My best friend, [A], is busy. [B] won’t respond. The only person that will respond is a 21 year old girl who only likes talking to me cause I give her attention, do things for her, and give her money. It kind of reminds me of that BIll Withers’ song, “Use Me Up.” I know its not particularly insightful to understand what that song is about, but it does feel particularly appropriate here. Basically, the song details the way in which this woman is using Bill, by taking advantage of him or putting him in particularly uncomfortable situations. He also talks about his friends tell[ing] him to get out of that relationship. In the end he points out that he’s using her too. I guess I feel the same way with [M]. clearly she's using me, but I get something out of it too. I like being told what to do and giving her money, and also her giving me all the details of her and men. Its sort of like a cuck relationship without the whole being there for the actual sex stuff.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Cost-Benefit Relationship</h2>
                         <p>I guess the bigger question is why do I like that? Another question is are all relationships like this? Are we all using each other? I’d argue yes. Why would we interact with anyone unless we get something out of the relationship? I think the real question is when does a relationship like that become bad/toxic/destructive? Thinking through this now, I see two possibilities: 1)We cease to get anything out of the relationship; 2) We are being used so much that any positives outweigh the negative. Do we constantly ask ourselves these questions throughout the duration of a <s>friendship</s> relationship? Seems kind of sad, but also necessary. Sad in that we would just be in a constant state of cost-benefit analysis with each of [our] relationships. Constantly asking what value each person brings into our lives. Constantly just determine what value each person brings us. Like saying, “I will only interact with someone if I get something out of it.” It seems dehumanizing and selfish, but on the other hand, it does seem healthy and even necessary to determine which people to stop interacting with. Maybe there is a balance. I’m not sure. It’s not necessary to say this, but obviously this is just me rambling.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Unwanted Answer</h2>
                         <p>Let’s go back to the other question, why do I like being told what to do? Or why do I like humiliation? I don’t know. It’s something I struggle with. I don’t have the capability of answering this question. Furthermore, I’m not sure I want the answer.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Family Pros and Cons</h2>
                         <p>I just spent Thanksgiving with my family. Pros and cons. It’s nice being with family, but at the same time they are irrational and aggravating. It also all seems so fake. I don’t necessarily “like” all of these people, but I have to act nice, because I have to. Seems kind of crazy. We have to interact as a by product of our relationship. As a by product of our circumstances. Is it possible to say no? Again I get into a cost-benefit analysis. The benefit is family, people that can spend time with and have the support of, but the cost is having to put on an act in order to not alienate myself.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Balancing Loneliness and Independence</h2>
                         <p>[I’m] sitting here writing, but also constantly checking my phone for any human interaction. I’m in a constant state of wanting people. It seems unhealthy but also very human. I don’t know what to do about it. How do I find a balance or how do I stop it? I’m not sure. I don’t think there is an answer or even a way out of it. <s>is it</s>.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Telling Lies</h2>
                         <p>Changing topics here, Is it okay to lie? To deceive? I don’t know. I guess my argument is yes, but it seems selfish? Why? Well because I lie in order to get things out of people. At what point is it too far? I think I have done too far. Is it too far once the truth will hurt the one we are lying to? In an ideal world, yes, but this is reality. I think I have to decide for myself when to stop lying.</p>
