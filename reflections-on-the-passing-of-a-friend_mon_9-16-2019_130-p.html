                         <!-- Paragraph -->
                         <p>I'm laying down in the sun at Zilker Park. I hurt my back at work and it's got me introspective. What should I be doing? The job search is harder than I thought it would be. It's hard to to wonder if I'm just not good enough. I got tired of rejection. I needed a break from it all. I’m at Zilker Park now. This is a place that I have one of my earliest memories in Austin. I don’t remember the exact year but I’ll guess sometime in 2010-11. We went walking on a trail, later discovered to be the greenbelt at Auditorium shores. It was hot. We saw a clearing in some brush and we decided to explore. As we made our way through the brush we started seeing a huge green expanse. It was beautiful. I didn't expect to see anything like this right in the middle of downtown. Just a wide open grass area of free space. I’m not sure why it was so amazing. I’ve been to the park before. I’ve seen grass and open spaces. There was something magical about discovering it with my friends. It felt like it was ours. Even now if you go at the right time you can be totally alone. It's far enough from the city to feel isolated from the chaos but close enough to appreciate the city. I think it's one of those “forests for the trees” type things.</p>

                         <!-- Section Heading -->
                         <h2 class="section-heading">Inevitable thoughts</h2>

                         <p>Being here I can’t stop thinking about my friend. He was a true friend that was always open to anything. He wasn’t judgemental. He accepted anyone and everyone. He was never too good for anyone. It's sometimes hard to remember he's gone. I wonder a lot about why he chose to go. What was he going for? Was he just curious? I’ve been curious. Will anything happen or is it just darkness and nothingness. I think most of all I miss playing music with him. We connected on a different level. As cheesy as that sounds it's true. There is something to be said about having a relationship with someone where they just get it. Everything he played inspired me. He challenged me to be better. I know I wasn’t the best drummer and he had multiple opportunities to play with other drummers but he accepted me and challenged me.</p>
