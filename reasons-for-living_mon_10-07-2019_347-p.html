                         <h2 class="section-heading">My Birthday</h2>

                         <p>It’s almost my birthday. I came here with the intention of writing a letter to my parents. This whole way up here I was thinking about what I’d say to them, but now that I'm sitting down I changed my mind and I don't know what I’d even say to them. There's a lot going on now, so I’d have to catch them up.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Birds in the Sun</h2>

                         <p>On the walk here I <s>say</s> saw some birds laying out in the sun. It made me think about the meaning of life. Why would they just lay there? Because that's what they <s>thing</s> think they are suppose to do. Just lay there. I kind of realized, there’s no meaning to life. I think we all define our own. <s>I don’t</s> maybe don’t define it consciously but our actions demonstrate what we value. I eat and drink a lot for different reasons. What does it mean to say life is meaningless? I’ve felt really bored and unsatisfied recently. H-E-B is done. No challenges. The job search has gone nowhere. It feels like I’ve put so much work in but nothing has happened. I still have to <s>don</s> do more.  Its crushing. I think alot about Cesar commiting suicide. I started seeing parallels between my life and his own. He put tons of work into “making it” in music but no real progress to show for it. I don’t know what his social situation <s>is like</s> was like but I can speak to my own. I’d say in general with myself it just feels like a lack of meaningful interactions. Even as I write that though I wonder how to define “meaningful”. <s>My maybe the issue… I don't think</s> On further thought, I don't think it is a lack of meaningful connections. I think what it comes down to is a lack of meaningful purpose in life. I’m not challenged or passionate about anything right now, son so I’m leaning on my relationships to fill that “lack”, but that won't happen. What’s next for me? A job. But when? I’m struggling to continue <s>lick</s> like this. I’m bored and aimless. I worry my UX skills are atrophying.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Cold and Raining</h2>

                         <p>I wish it was colder and I wish it was raining. I want to move. Sometimes I wonder if I should be single for more freedom. Writing that makes me feel silly. Silly for a couple of reasons: what freedoms am I currently missing by being in a relationship? Also, silly because I was thinking about all the things people do because they think they are supposed to? There are so many things we do and believe is right because thats how were we were taught, but in <s>real</s> reality there is no actual right and wrong. There is no meaning[ful] list of rules. There are laws but those are just <s>define rules</s> rules agreed to by society. Why is it wrong to cause people harm? Or to cause yourself harm? From a human’s perspective it’s wrong because we wouldn’t want them to cause us harm, but if you think about it, is it really wrong?I don’t know why I’m thinking about this or if I even really agree with it or maybe I was just following a rabbit down the hole.</p>
