                         <h2 class="section-heading">I’m Lost</h2>

                         <!-- Paragraph -->
                         <p>I don’t know what to say. I feel lost. I feel alone. I don’t know what to do. I feel like my life isn’t enough. I’m not interested or challenged by anything going on. I went to school to provide me with a chance for something more, but now I can’t get a job with my degree. I worry I wasted my time. I don’t know what would make me feel not alone. When I did meet someone [I] could spend all my time with, I got bored. I’m thinking I just have an insatiable appetite for human interaction. It's never enough. I’m just making this stuff up. I don’t know what's going on. I guess I’m saying I’m down and depressed. I pick up my phone hoping something interesting is happening so I can distract myself, but it's never anything. Never anything of substance or really interesting. If it is then its fleeting. It comes and goes and I’m left wanting more. Is it my fault for wanting and expecting my life to be constantly filled with life altering stuff? I feel like a fraud and like a liar. I feel like I’m not good enough. I don’t know what I’m going to do if I don’t get the IBM jobs. I’ll have to reevaluate my whole approach. I don’t want to think about it.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Rock Bottom</h2>
                         <p>Life is hard. I started smoking. I can’t for certain why. In retrospect, I think it's because I’m down. I’m at the bottom, but I wanted to see how much lower I could go. Smoking feels lower. I feel like I deserve it. I’m ashamed by it. I try to hide it. Febreeze, mouth wash, and so forth. I don’t want people to know, but at the same time I do? I want someone to notice. It’s like a cry for help, but I think… I don’t think anyone can help. I don’t think its right to expect people help me. What can they do? Everyone else is going through their own stuff and helping me is unreasonable, but I still try. It’s interesting reaching to coffee/food/alcohol/smoking to try to alter my mood. Like I’m depressed, so I grab a coffee. Even right now I’m smoking and drinking coffee and drinking a beer. <s>We are ta</s> Are we taught that these things help? Do they? Part of me feels that they do. Even if they don’t, I still try. Why? I’m sure on some level (biological) they help/ Maybe not actually help. Actually for sure they don’t actually help. They just fill the space and/or time. It's like a band-aid, right?</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">Honest and Forward</h2>
                         <p>I enjoyed my talk with Brit. For a couple of reasons. I find her attractive and I guess on some level I wanted something to happen physically, so I feel guilty about that, but I also enjoyed her enabling and in some cases encouraging my self-destructive behavior drinking and <s>such</s> smoking and staying up late, but I also appreciate the nature of our conversation. We could talk about anything and take it to the nth degree. I don’t have that with many people. That night I realized what deflecting is. We all do it. A difficult topic of conversation? Just change the subject or place the focus on something beside the point. It’s unreasonable to expect people do not do it. It's unreasonable to expect everyone to be honest and forward. I'm not honest. I'm far from it. I can sometimes be forward but it's to no real good. I guess I’m saying when I am honest and forward about my own issues its to no end. <s>When I say to no and I mean like deprit heal me.</s> It’s just an intellectual exercise. I realize the issue or the facts, but no real growth comes from it. As an example let's consider my issue of death. I hate that it's an inevitable outcome. I don’t want to die, but I realize it will happen and that’s it. I can say that, but what does it do? I still don’t accept it and I’m still scared. I’m just rambling here.</p>

                         <h2 class="section-heading">The balance of Nihilism and Wants</h2>
                         <p>What do I talk about now? What is nihilism? Without doing any research I think it's acknowledging that everything is meaningless. Life is a series of events, that humans assign meaning to, but in reality, in the grand scheme, in the universe, there is no meaning. Things happen and some things don’t happen. Regardless of any meaning we assign them. Not to say that it doesn’t matter if we care or not, because if we do care then I’d say we can [affect] those outcomes. The more we care about something, then the more effort we put in to try to achieve it, but is some cases regardless of how much we want some thing and try to make it happen the universe doesn’t care.  [My friend’s] death, or for that matter, my own death. It's going to happen regardless of how much effort I put into the contrary.</p>

                         <p><s>The world is</s> For those things that don’t have an inevitable outcome (death), it's really about a negotiation of human wants. To clarify, I mean that one person wants something to happen and a different person wants something also to happen. Negotiating those two different desired outcomes is life. Getting people to want what you want is hard. It's a valuable skill.  How do you do it? Manipulation? Inspiring others? Lying? Convincing? Iron will? Not taking no for an answer? I don’t know. I realize the value in this skill but at some point who has the energy? Why even try? It’s all trivial. It's hard finding something you want. Actually scratch that. It's easy finding wants, <s>but</s> it's actually hard finding something that you want and that's worth fighting for it. Actually that's easy too. What's actually hard is the fighting. It's draining, fighting. It's easier to accept what's the easiest path. My motivation is that life is short and why not try? We owe it to ourselves to try to maximize our own happiness. Why not? It’s my life so why not make it the life I want? That’s an easy thing to say. It's harder to do. Like most things. I go back and forth. Obviously. I want things but struggle with the fight to make them happen. Is it cause I don’t want it enough? Maybe. It’s just so easy to find distractions. When things are hard, it's easy to just avoid the fight and go for what's easy or pleasurable. Even now I’m writing and feeling anxious about what I’m talking about so I go to my phone to think/focus on something else that's easier. More fun. I don’t judge that. I guess actually I do, but I do understand the reasons why we do it. Why not do it? If we owe it to ourselves to maximize happiness why not just always do fun things? Why not? The real problem is the definition of happiness? Is happiness just surface level fun or distraction or is it meaningful and fulfilling. Maybe all of it. Its enjoying distraction, and being fulfilled. It's a balancing act. Is it ¼ distraction/fun and ¾ fulfillment?</p>
